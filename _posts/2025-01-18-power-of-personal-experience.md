🌟 **Since ChatGPT became widely available and popular, being an "expert in everything" has never been easier.**
Every day, my feed is flooded with articles like *"Git Cheat Sheet"* or *"10 Tips to Be the Best Manager."* Posting regularly is considered essential for building a personal brand — because without it, they say, you simply don’t exist in today’s world.

But with every new list of "helpful" advice, repetitive content grows exponentially. When I see such posts, I often think, *"Well, congrats, you’ve mastered ChatGPT."* But honestly, I’d much rather read about someone’s **personal experience.** Every one of us faces unique challenges at work, solves problems, and gains insights. That’s what makes content valuable — because it’s **authentic** and grounded in reality.

💡 **Here’s an example from my own experience:**
We once faced a flood of non-constructive negative feedback on a gaming website. Frustrated players, in the heat of the moment, would vent their emotions through the feedback form. Reading and moderating those messages was… unpleasant, to say the least.

Then we came up with an unexpected solution: we redesigned the feedback form. Now, it used a polite template with elegant calligraphy, almost inviting users to write in a respectful tone.

 **And guess what? It worked!**
People found it uncomfortable to express anger in such a beautiful format. The harsh messages disappeared, and the most negative thing we started receiving was a sarcastic *"Without respect."* 🚀 Problem solved!

Stories like this are unique because they reflect real-life situations. They’re not just another list of generic advice — they’re a window into how you think, act, and solve problems.

🤖 **Use ChatGPT wisely:**
Leverage it to structure your thoughts, refine your tone, or brainstorm ideas to convey your message. It’s a powerful tool that can strengthen your content.

⚠️ **But don’t clutter the internet** with yet another list of tips for situations you haven’t experienced yourself.

✨ **Instead, share what makes you unique:**
- What you do,
- How you solve problems,
- The challenges you face,
- The insights you gain.

That’s your unique contribution, and it’s far more valuable than something a machine could generate.

💪 **Let the power of personal experience be with you!**
