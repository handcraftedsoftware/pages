Hi! I want to share my planner with you, which has been helping me balance work and personal life for several years. It’s designed for one week. A5 format, 29 pages.

Each day, I write down three important tasks for work, three for my personal project, and three for home. I also track my mood, productivity, and well-being, noting what upset me and what made me happy, along with a key insight of the day—something that inspired me or something new I learned. For health, I try to walk or exercise daily, read, nurture social connections, and work on my personal project.

Try "One productive week" and start your journey to personal growth. Make every week count!
